      <br>
      <p class="contentText">This webapp tries to introduce a practical approach to Stephen Covey's defining work,"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People." The book in itself offers a great deal of insight but as the author and common sense dictates, a framework in which to practice and concrete action is necessary as well. This is what we've tried to develop in the scope of the Internet and Mobile Services semester project.</p>
      <br>
      <h3 class="contentTitle">What you'll find</h3>
      <br>
      <p class="contentText">The ideas and paradigms of the book are not quick fixes or what people call "silver bullets". Therefore, the way each person interprets and applies the theoretical knowledge varies. Nonethless, we've tried to focus on the most important and cataclystic ideas that hold the greatest promise for noticeable results within 30 days. </p>
      <br>    
      <h3 class="contentTitle">How to use</h3>
      <br>
      <p class="contentText">The ideal use case for this webapp is to assign some time before ending the day and reflecting on the mission statement and roles in your life. The app also includes a positive reinforcement progress check, the aim of which is to keep users interested in this development framework.</p>
